### Calculating the mean for each of the 5 ratings: 'review/appearance', 'review/palate', 'review/overall', 
### 'review/aroma', 'review/taste'.

### Calculating mean ABV

### Dividing the dataset into two where the first half is the training set and the second half for test.

zipped = [a - b for a, b in zip(y1, blahh)]
squared = [a**2 for a in zipped]
blah = sum(squared)
mse = blah / 25000

print "Mean-squared error: " + str(mse)

### avgTaste = mean('review/taste', data1)
### mse = ((theta[1] - avgTaste) ** 2).mean(axis=None)

testSet = [d for d in data2 if d.has_key('beer/ABV')]
